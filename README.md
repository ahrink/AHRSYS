Enhanced Absorption of AHRSYS Concept

AHRSYS represents a dynamic trading platform with a user-friendly interface tailored to cater to a personalized list of traded symbols or those requiring detailed analysis and refinement. This catalog, referred to as the Opportunity Finder (OF), serves as a pivotal tool for portfolio management and in-depth examination of specific financial instruments.

In exploring the potential collaboration between AHRSYS and ClangOpenSourceLib, the aim is to harness the latter as the primary charting engine. This collaboration emphasizes the importance of optimizing internal processes for minimal latency. Conceptually, this collaboration can be divided into two distinct modules: order execution and data plotting (charting). To ensure optimal performance, it's envisioned to have two separate instances of ClangOpenSourceLib runningâ€”one to drive the symbol list and another to handle charting.

The customization of data analytics through a "chart design manager" serves as a supplementary tool, separate from live trading or day trading activities. To avoid any impact on live trading, it's advisable to utilize a separate machine for chart tailoring purposes.

Key considerations underscored previously include:

AHRSYS primarily functions as a market performance scanner.
The platform is designed with modularity in mind.
Resource efficiency is crucial, particularly with the potential resource demands of the symbol list.
Order execution takes precedence over the data plotting module.
The inclusion of a "tailoring shop" is primarily for commercial purposes.
Compatibility across different operating systems, including OSX, Windows, and Unix-like systems, is essential.
Time efficiency is paramount in facilitating swift trading.
Flexibility in incorporating other programming languages for the charting engine and symbol list driver should be explored.
While industry buzzwords like A.I., automated trading, algorithms, viruses, neural networks, and machine learning are relevant, the focus remains on custom programming to meet specific needs.

In contrast to many branded platforms, AHRSYS aims to offer a unique trading experience with customizable features. The suggestion of a donation option reflects a desire to enhance the platform further, albeit within limited means.

AHRSYS and ClangOpenSourceLib present a promising synergy, inviting users to contribute to their development and adoption. However, the current capacity for contribution is constrained, underscoring the potential for growth and enhancement in the future.
